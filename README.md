# ImplementationDocs
Repo for documentation and collecting things for implementing GitHub at Rio.

## Questions
* What is the stance on licenses that should be applied to repos?
  * How will this affect student repos?
* Is there concern about using personal accounts and the College/District saying that any work on those accounts belong to them?
  * Until further notice, the thinking is that if the project/content being worked on is within a District Enterprise Org, then it belongs to the College/District. Any personal work should be placed within personal repos outside of the enterprise.

## Roles
* **Designated Admins** - District Office IT. Manage the enterprise.
* **Department Admins** - Department level administrators. 
  * There can be many department admins.
  * They do not need to follow the structure within HCM.
  * They must submit an [Administrator Contact Form](https://airtable.com/shrqHkJkfGPgo4Q7J) to GitHub to self-identify as an administrator. 
  * They will help others within the department and/or other departments with implementing and using GitHub.
  * They will have ongoing responsibilities:
    * Clean up inactive users
