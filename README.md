## Questions
* What is the stance on licenses that should be applied to repos?
* Is there concern about using personal accounts and the College/District saying that any work on those accounts belong to them?

## Roles

* **Department Admins** - Department level administrators. 
  * There can be many department admins.
  * They do not need to follow the structure within HCM.
  * They must submit a form to GitHub to self-identify as an administrator.
  * They will help others within the department and/or other departments with implementing and using GitHub.
  * They will have ongoing responsibilities:
