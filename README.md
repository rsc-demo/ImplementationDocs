# ImplementationDocs
Repo for documentation and collecting things for implementing GitHub at Rio.

## Questions
* What is the stance on licenses that should be applied to repos?
* Is there concern about using personal accounts and the College/District saying that any work on those accounts belong to them?

## Classroom Usage
* Faculty (and grading teams) need to be owners of an organization to be assigned in Classroom.
* The classrooms pull their permissions from the organization it is associated with.

**Classroom Structure**
1. Create an organization. (Course based, Term based, or AY based?)
2. Create a repo(s) of the assignment.
   1. One repo for continuous project across lessons.
   2. Multi repos for one project per lesson.
3. Create a classroom associated with the organization.
