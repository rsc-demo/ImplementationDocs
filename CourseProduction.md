This readme file contains the steps and process that Course Production will need to use to set up Classrooms within Github and prepare the invitation links for students.

## Overview of Process
1. Log into [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) with the Course Production account.
2. Create a new Classroom associated with the course organization. See Create a Classroom
3. Create the necessary assignments within the new classroom. See Create an assignment.
4. Copy the assignment invitation links to the appropriate database file. See Assignment Invitations.
5. Copy the invitation link for the TAs/Adjuncts to join the classroom. See Invite Adjuncts to Classroom.

## Create a Classroom

2. Select the organization associated with the course that will match the version within Course Definition. e.g., RSC-CIS233DA-V8-IN.
    1. The organization for the course should be created during the course development process by the developer/dept./ID.
