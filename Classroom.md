This document will have information about the Classroom Structure.

## Important Notes
1. Teachers and admin must be owners on the organization.
2. The organization where student repos will be stored should have strict permissions.
3. Classrooms can be archived. *Need to determine archival process.*

## Classroom Overview
1. The classroom is like a section in RioLearn that contains the student roster and quick access to their repos.
   1. It contains the assignments for the course (and practice activities?).
   2. It contains a list of students.
2. The student repos are stored within a main organization.
   1. All classrooms that point to the organization will have the student repos stored within it.
   2. This could make the org similar to our classweb server with all student information contained within it.
   3. Instructors shouldn't need to access the org directly if they use classroom.
3. All classrooms have unique links for students to click on.
   1. Students click on a link to be placed into a roster and link up their GitHub account with the roster name.
   2. Students click on the links to accept the assignment, which creates the repo.
4. Classroom rosters can be imported via LTI implementation. This is the prefered method.
5. When the classroom is set up, the TA and admin need to be added by Course Production.
   1. TAs would be the adjunct faculty/instructional team. *(Need to determine if we can set up a team in the org and be allowed to assign a team as a TA/Admin to make it easier for CP)*
   2. A join link for the TA/Admin needs to be sent to them so they have access.
