# Naming Conventions
These will be the naming conventions we will use for setting things up.

## Orgs
1. All orgs will start with "rsc-" to indicate it is for Rio Salado College
2. Department orgs will contain the department name (e.g., rsc-computer-technology, rsc-media)
3. Student orgs will follow this format: Course-Modality-Version-SpecialtyCode
   1. e.g., CIS233DA-in-v8
   2. A specialty code may not be used and can be left off if there is none.
## Template Repos
1. Will follow this format: Course-Version-L#-TypeOfActivity
   1. e.g., CIS233DA-v8-L1-Project, CIS233DA-v8-L1-PracticeActivity, etc.
## Classroom Names
1. Will follow this format: Year Course Section Semester
   1. e.g., 2020 CIS233DA 99999 Fall
2. This matches the same format used in TestOut to name courses in that platform. So, this is for consistency.
## Student Repos
1. Will follow this format: Term-Section-L#-TypeOfActivity
   1. E.g., 4206-99999-L1-Project
2. The student's GitHub username will be appended to the repo name by GitHub Classroom.
