# To Test
* How students will submit assignments:
  * Option 1 - Students do work in development branch, then create and merge pull request to submit. Will trigger feedback pull request note to instructor.
  * Option 2 - Students do work in main branch and add comment to Feedback pull request to indicate it is ready for grading.
    * Will instructor get email with comment? Will there be too much email for the various commits?
