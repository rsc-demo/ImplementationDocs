# Recap
- LTI integration will be put on hold for now to focus on other aspects. 
  - There is a lot to do for this and there will already be a lot to figure out.
  - I believe the LTI for RL will be worked on over spring, which may bring additional functionality that may help integrating at a later date.
  - The system should still be usable without LTI.

# Next Steps
- We need to work through the processes we will use to use it within CIS233DA so we can develop the repos, etc. appropriately.
  - Development should start after the new year.
- What we need to test:
  - [ ] Providing unique acceptance links to students on a per section basis.
  - [ ] Process on setting up Classroom for each new section. Potentially automate some of it.
  - [ ] Go through student experience to determine what may go wrong.
  - [ ] How adjuncts will identify students in Classrooms vs. RL roster.
  - [ ] How adjuncts will grade assignments.
  
# What do we need
- CourseArc needs
  - Dummy class with lessons
- RioLearn
  - Dummy sections with adjuncts students
- GitHub
  - Template repos
  - Classroom setup
- Accounts
  - I created a GH account for CIS.Lead, could potentially be used later by our Lead Faculty. Can be used to help test.
